# Pot pourri of remarks on presentation.tex
- It looks good already!
- Slide 6 (and others): "update y_j as:". The typographical rule for the comma ":" is different in English and in French. In french there should always be a non-breaking space ("ins√©cable") and in English it should always be attached to the last word. 
- Try to use the command \alert{message to be put forward} to highlight some parts of the slide to make it more easy to read. Try to \alert on a few things on each slide. It works in both "normal" environement and in math mode without issues and automatically format the way the message is highlighted with the template (the command is quite robust in that sense). Like in Slide 4, keywords like "mass conservation" should be highlighted.
- Use \ell instead of "l".
- Slide 4: make the same choice of notation for I and J, it is different in the min and in the constraints currently.
- Slide 12: is currently missing on the version I looked to.
- Maybe make one slide at the end on prospective goals as a separate section (to be added in the outline).
