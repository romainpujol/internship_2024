	abstract = {Entropic regularization is quickly emerging as a new standard in optimal transport ({OT}). It enables to cast the {OT} computation as a differentiable and unconstrained convex optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved using the Sinkhorn algorithm. However, entropy keeps the transportation plan strictly positive and therefore completely dense, unlike unregularized {OT}. This lack of sparsity can be problematic in applications where the transportation plan itself is of interest. In this paper, we explore regularizing the primal and dual {OT} formulations with a strongly convex term, which corresponds to relaxing the dual and primal constraints with smooth approximations. We show how to incorporate squared \$2\$-norm and group lasso regularizations within that framework, leading to sparse and group-sparse transportation plans. On the theoretical side, we bound the approximation error introduced by regularizing the primal and dual formulations. Our results suggest that, for the regularized primal, the approximation error can often be smaller with squared \$2\$-norm than with entropic regularization. We showcase our proposed framework on the task of color transfer.},

	abstract = {In the field of data-driven optimization under uncertainty, scenario reduction is a commonly used technique for computing a smaller number of scenarios to improve computational tractability and interpretability. However traditional approaches do not consider the decision quality when computing these scenarios. In “Optimization-Based Scenario Reduction for Data-Driven Two-Stage Stochastic Optimization,” Bertsimas and Mundru present a novel optimization-based method that explicitly considers the objective and problem structure for reducing the number of scenarios needed for solving two-stage stochastic optimization problems. This new proposed method is generally applicable and has significantly better performance when the number of reduced scenarios is 1\%–2\% of the full sample size compared with other state-of-the-art optimization and randomization methods, which suggests this improves both tractability and interpretability.
          , 
            We propose a novel, optimization-based method that takes into account the objective and problem structure for reducing the number of scenarios, m, needed for solving two-stage stochastic optimization problems. We develop a corresponding convex optimization-based algorithm and show that, as the number of scenarios increase, the proposed method recovers the {SAA} solution. We report computational results with both synthetic and real-world data sets that show that the proposed method has significantly better performance for [Formula: see text] of n in relation to other state of the art methods (importance sampling, Monte Carlo sampling, and Wasserstein scenario reduction with squared Euclidean norm). Additionally, we propose variants of classical scenario reduction algorithms (which rely on the Euclidean norm) and show that these variants consistently outperform their traditional versions.
